    - Our Java 8 code base is centred around the LibGDX framework, where core assets can be found in the `core` folder, and the desktop specific code can be found in the `desktop` folder. We use gradle as our build tool. A more in-depth description of our code can be found in the [Maintenance Guide](documentation/maintenance-guide.md) and [Javadoc](http://boxx-javadoc.surge.sh/).
