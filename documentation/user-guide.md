# User Guide
## 1 Introduction

Welcome to Boxx. Boxx is a Java based puzzle game in which, as the name suggests, the aim is to use boxes to complete all of the levels. In order to complete Boxx, you'll have to navigate mazes, complete puzzles, and outwit ghosts and ogres! Get familiar with the <kbd>r</kbd> key on your keyboard, because there will probably be some restarting involved too! The goal is simple; get the boxes where they need to go, and avoid enemies whilst doing it. The game will start easy and get harder as you progress, and if you feel like a real pro, feel free to turn on 'Hard Mode' for added challenge. Ready? Let's get started!

### 1.1 Objective

As difficult as it may be to believe having played Boxx, we do actually want you to enjoy yourself! We hope that the satisfaction that comes from finally figuring out that puzzle, or trapping that pesky enemy is something that you will be able to enjoy either on your own or with a friend in our co-operative multiplayer mode. The game is challenging, particularly in later levels, but we're sure your're up to the task!

## 2 Installation

Before you try to play the game, please ensure that you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your device. You can download JRE using [this link](https://www.java.com/en/download/) if you haven't got it already. Once you have downloaded JRE and the Boxx.jar file, you can play the game by simply right clicking on the file and clicking open. Boxx is still in the early stages of the development process, and so is currently only available to play on Desktop.

## 3. First steps

### 3.1 Before running the game

Before you start, please adjust your volume to a suitable level, as the game is packed with music and effects. We've found out for ourselves that as much as we love the music, not everyone else in the library always does.
 
### 3.2 Controls 

All of the controls we're about to describe can also be found in the 'Help' page in-game if you forget them later!

#### 3.2.1 Movement 

When you enter the game, you are thrown in at the deep end with your first level, which also happens to be the main menu. To move, simply use the keyboard for:

| Key     | Direction |
| ------- | --------- |
| <kbd>⇧</kbd> | Up   |
| <kbd>⇦</kbd>  | Left  |
| <kbd>⇩</kbd>   | Down   |
| <kbd>⇨</kbd> | Right   |

If you start a multiplayer game, the second player can move using the same keyboard, and: 

| Key     | Direction |
| ------- | --------- |
| <kbd>W</kbd> | Up   |
| <kbd>A</kbd>  | Left  |
| <kbd>S</kbd>   | Down   |
| <kbd>D</kbd> | Right   |

#### 3.2.2 Shortucts 

In order to making navigating the menus easy, we've added a few shortcuts:

| Key     | Shortcut |
| ------- | --------- |
| <kbd>esc</kbd> | Back to the main menu.   |
| <kbd>i</kbd>  | Into the settings menu (can also be used to pause the game).  |
| <kbd>h</kbd>   | Into the help menu.   |
| <kbd>r</kbd> | Restart the level (handy for when you've got a box stuck somewhere you shouldn't!).  |

### 3.3 The Menus

You can rage quit the game at any time by walking (or storming) through the 'Exit' on the left hand side of the main menu. We encourage you to take regular breaks, finally completing that level you've been grinding away at for hours is not worth your sanity.

#### 3.3.1 Game mode selection

We have two game modes available, these are single player and multiplayer. To choose one, just walk over to the stairs that lead to the corresponding game mode. You'll find yourself in another menu, in which you can start a new game, or continue a game that you've already started.

#### 3.3.2 Settings

To change your settings, just walk up to one of the boxes in the settings menu and move it around. 
There are three different controls available in the settings menu:

| Setting     | Function |
| ------- | --------- |
| Enemy Speed | The further left this box is, the slower the enemies are. |
| Hard Mode | For elite players only. When this is turned on, you'll be given a 'fog' which only allows you to see boxes and enemies that are within range. |
| Volume   | This ranges from off (on the left hand side) to full, glorious emersion (right hand side). |
 
## 4 Playing the game

We believe that figuring out the rules is part of the challenge, so for those of you that want to figure things out for yourselves, please look away now!

### 4.1 Box Placement

If you see a square on the map that looks like <img src="https://github.com/perrymant/dungeon-game/blob/master/core/assets/temp/area.png" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="20" height="20" border="10" /></a> , and think to yourself "this looks suspiciously box shaped", you'd be right! The goal of this level is to get the boxes around any obstacles or mazes in the way and place it on this location. While you're doing so, make sure that you don't get caught by any ghosts!

### 4.2 Ogre Trapping

If you see one of these charming guys <img src="https://github.com/perrymant/dungeon-game/blob/master/core/assets/temp/monster.png" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="20" height="20" border="10" /></a> on the map, and think to yourself "I should definitely avoid him", you'd be right! Unfortunately, things aren't quite that simple in Boxx. The challenge in these levels is to trap the Ogre to prevent them from harrassing unsuspecting protagonists in the future. To do this, just push the boxes that are coincidentally strewn across the map around unitl you have them surrounded! As soon as none of the ogres can move, you win the level.

### 4.3 Multiplayer

If you happen to have a friend brave enough to join you on your adventure, you'll have found yourself in a multiplayer level. These will vary in how you have to tackle them, but the basic goals are the same as in sections 3.1 and 3.2. You'll have to work together (or all on your own in some cases) to get boxes where they need to go, or trap pesky ogres, in order to progress in this game mode. If things go wrong and you have an unfortunate encounter with a ghost, just remember - you always have each other (to blame).

### 4.4 Move Counting

You'll notice when you load up the game that there is a move counter in the top right hand corner of the screen. This is just there so you can tell how many moves it takes you to complete the game, so that you can compare against your friends, and it will reset every time you close the game. Feel free to tie your self worth to this number, it is extremely important.
